        "Ramu owns a Pan shop and he manages it in his own way. While in a normal shop, a customer is served by following the first-come, first-served rule, Ramu simply minimizes the average waiting time of his customers. So he gets to decide who is served first, regardless of how sooner or later a person comes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Different kinds of Pans take different amounts of time to cook. Also, once he starts cooking a Pan, he cannot cook another Pan until the first Pan is completely cooked. Let's say we have three customers who come at time t=0, t=1, & t=2 respectively, and the time needed to cook their Pans is 3, 9, & 6 respectively. If Ramu applies first-come, first-served rule, then the waiting time of three customers is 3, 11, & 16 respectively. The average waiting time in this case is (3 + 11 + 16) / 3 = 10. This is not an optimized solution. After serving the first customer at time t=3, Ramu can choose to serve the third customer. In that case, the waiting time will be 3, 7, & 17 respectively. Hence the average waiting time is (3 + 7 + 17) / 3 = 9.\n",

        "Help Ramu achieve the minimum average waiting time. For the sake of simplicity, just find the integer part of the minimum average waiting time.\n"
